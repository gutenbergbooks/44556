his many valiant fights in the cause of liberty deserves to be better
known than they are."--_St. James's Gazette._

fiction together with so skilful a hand that the reader cannot help
acquiring a just and clear view of that fierce and terrible struggle
which gave to us our Indian Empire."--_Athenæum._

     G. A. HENTY. With 12 full-page Illustrations by RALPH
     PEACOCK. 6_s._

"Mr. Henty is a giant among boys' writers, and his books are
sufficiently popular to be sure of a welcome anywhere.... In stirring
interest, this is quite up to the level of Mr. Henty's former
historical tales."--_Saturday Review._

     Fire. By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by
     J. FINNEMORE. 6_s._

"No boy needs to have any story of Henty's recommended to him, and
parents who do not know and buy him for their boys should be ashamed
of themselves. Those to whom he is yet unknown could not make a better
beginning than with _When London Burned_."--_British Weekly._


BY G. A. HENTY

     GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

produced any story more delightful, more wholesome, or more vivacious.
From first to last it will be read with keen enjoyment."--_The Saturday
Review._

     =By England's Aid:= The Freeing of the Netherlands (1585-1604).

Review._

     =With Wolfe in Canada:= or, The Winning of a Continent. By G.
     A. HENTY. Illustrated with 12 page Pictures by GORDON
     BROWNE. 6_s._

"A model of what a boys' story-book should be. Mr. Henty has a great
power of infusing into the dead facts of history new life, and as no
pains are spared by him to ensure accuracy in historic details, his
books supply useful aids to study as well as amusement."--_School
Guardian._

     =Bonnie Prince Charlie:= A Tale of Fontenoy and Culloden. By
     G. A. HENTY. Illustrated with 12 page Pictures by
     GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

"Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of _Quentin Durward_. The
lad's journey across France with his faithful attendant Malcolm, and
his hairbreadth escapes from the machinations of his father's enemies
make up as good a narrative of the kind as we have ever read. For
freshness of treatment and variety of incident, Mr. Henty has here
surpassed himself."--_Spectator._

     HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by S. J. SOLOMON,
     and a Coloured Map. 6_s._

     Independence. By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations
     by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

"Does justice to the pluck and determination of the British soldiers.
The son of an American loyalist, who remains true to our flag, falls
among the hostile redskins in that very Huron country which has been
endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye and Chingachgook."--_The
Times._

"Mr. Henty undoubtedly possesses the secret of writing eminently
successful historical tales; and those older than the lads whom
the author addresses in his preface may read the story with
pleasure."--_Academy._

tales."--_Scotsman._

     of Religion. By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Pictures by
     J. SCHÖNBERG. 6_s._

"A praiseworthy attempt to interest British youth in the great deeds of
the Scotch Brigade in the wars of Gustavus Adolphus. Mackay, Hepburn,
and Munro live again in Mr. Henty's pages, as those deserve to live
whose disciplined bands formed really the germ of the modern British
army."--_Athenæum._

     =The Young Carthaginian:= A Story of the Times of Hannibal. By
     G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by C. J.
     STANILAND, R.I. 6_s._

"The effect of an interesting story, well constructed and vividly told,
is enhanced by the picturesque quality of the scenic background. From
first to last nothing stays the interest of the narrative. It bears us
along as on a stream whose current varies in direction, but never loses
its force."--_Saturday Review._

     =Redskin and Cow-boy:= A Tale of the Western Plains. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by ALFRED PEARSE. 6_s._

"It has a good plot; it abounds in action; the scenes are equally
spirited and realistic, and we can only say we have read it with much
pleasure from first to last. The pictures of life on a cattle ranch are
most graphically painted, as are the manners of the reckless but jovial
cow-boys."--_Times._

     =With Clive in India:= or, The Beginnings of an Empire. By G.
     A. HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

"Among writers of stories of adventure for boys Mr. Henty stands in the
very first rank. Those who know something about India will be the most
ready to thank Mr. Henty for giving them this instructive volume to
place in the hands of their children."--_Academy._

     =In Greek Waters:= A Story of the Grecian War of Independence
     (1821-1827). By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations
     by W. S. STACEY, and a Map. 6_s._

"There are adventures of all kinds for the hero and his friends, whose
pluck and ingenuity in extricating themselves from awkward fixes are
always equal to the occasion. It is an excellent story, and if the
proportion of history is smaller than usual, the whole result leaves
nothing to be desired."--_Journal of Education._

     =The Dash for Khartoum:= A Tale of the Nile Expedition. By G.
     A. HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by J. SCHÖNBERG
     and J. NASH, and 4 Plans. 6_s._

"It is literally true that the narrative never flags a moment; for the
incidents which fall to be recorded after the dash for Khartoum has
been made and failed are quite as interesting as those which precede
it."--_Academy._


BY G. A. HENTY.

"Mr. Henty is the king of story-tellers for boys."--_Sword and Trowel._

_In crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges._

     HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.
     6_s._

"Mr. Henty inspires a love and admiration for straightforwardness,
truth, and courage. This is one of the best of the many good books
Mr. Henty has produced, and deserves to be classed with his _Facing
Death_."--_Standard._

     =Captain Bayley's Heir:= A Tale of the Gold Fields of California.
     By G. A. HENTY. Illustrated by H. M. PAGET. 6_s._

"A Westminster boy who makes his way in the world by hard work, good
temper, and unfailing courage. The descriptions given of life are
just what a healthy intelligent lad should delight in."--_St. James's
Gazette._

[Illustration: _Reduced Illustration from "A Knight of the White
Cross"._]

     =St. Bartholomew's Eve:= A Tale of the Huguenot Wars. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by H. J. DRAPER. 6_s._

"What would boys do without Mr. Henty? Ever fresh and vigorous, his
books have at once the solidity of history and the charm of romance.
_St. Bartholomew's Eve_ is in his best style, and the interest never
flags. The book is all that could possibly be wished from a boy's point
of view."--_Journal of Education._

     =In Freedom's Cause:= A Story of Wallace and Bruce. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

"His tale of the days of Wallace and Bruce is full of stirring action,
and will commend itself to boys."--_Athenæum._

     =By Right of Conquest=: or, With Cortez in Mexico. By G. A.
     HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by W. S. STACEY.
     6_s._

perfectly successful historical tale that Mr. Henty has yet
published."--_Academy._


BY G. A. HENTY.

"Mr. Henty is one of the best of story-tellers for young
people."--_Spectator._

_In crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges._

     =Beric the Briton:= A Story of the Roman Invasion. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by W. PARKINSON. 6_s._

"We are not aware that anyone has given us quite so vigorous a picture
of Britain in the days of the Roman conquest. Mr. Henty has done his
utmost to make an impressive picture of the haughty Roman character,
with its indomitable courage, sternness, and discipline. _Beric_ is
good all through."--_Spectator._

     =By Pike and Dyke:= A Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic. By
     G. A. HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by MAYNARD
     BROWN, and 4 Maps. 6_s._

"The mission of Ned to deliver letters from William the Silent to his
adherents at Brussels, the fight of the _Good Venture_ with the Spanish
man-of-war, the battle on the ice at Amsterdam, the siege of Haarlem,
are all told with a vividness and skill which are worthy of Mr. Henty
at his best."--_Academy._

[Illustration: _Reduced Illustration from "At Agincourt"._]

     =Wulf the Saxon:= A Story of the Norman Conquest. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by RALPH PEACOCK. 6_s._

"_Wulf the Saxon_ is second to none of Mr. Henty's historical tales,
and we may safely say that a boy may learn from it more genuine
history than he will from many a tedious tome. The points of the Saxon
character are hit off very happily, and the life of the period is ably
reconstructed."--_The Spectator._

     =Through the Sikh War:= A Tale of the Conquest of the Punjaub.
     By G. A. HENTY. With 12 page Illustrations by HAL
     HURST, and a Map. 6_s._

"The picture of the Punjaub during its last few years of independence,
the description of the battles on the Sutlej, and the portraiture
generally of native character, seem admirably true.... On the whole,
we have never read a more vivid and faithful narrative of military
adventure in India."--_The Academy._


BY G. A. HENTY.

"No more interesting boys' books are written than Mr. Henty's
stories."--_Daily Chronicle._

_In crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges._

     =With Lee in Virginia:= A Story of the American Civil War. By
     G. A. HENTY. With 10 page Illustrations by GORDON
     BROWNE, and 6 Maps. 6_s._

"The story is a capital one and full of variety, and presents us with
many picturesque scenes of Southern life. Young Wingfield, who is
conscientious, spirited, and 'hard as nails', would have been a man
after the very heart of Stonewall Jackson."--_Times._

     =Under Drake's Flag:= A Tale of the Spanish Main. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 6_s._

"There is not a dull chapter, nor, indeed, a dull page in the book; but
the author has so carefully worked up his subject that the exciting
deeds of his heroes are never incongruous or absurd."--_Observer._

     Moscow. By G. A. HENTY. With 8 Illustrations by W. H.

"Julian, the hero of the story, early excites our admiration, and is
altogether a fine character such as boys will delight in, whilst the
story of the campaign is very graphically told.... Will, we think,
prove one of the most popular boys' books this season."--_St. James's
Gazette._

     By G. A. HENTY. Illustrated by G. C. HINDLEY.

fiction."--_Academy._

     With 8 page Illustrations by W. H. OVEREND, and 2 Maps.
     5_s._

"Written with Homeric vigour and heroic inspiration. It is graphic,
picturesque, and dramatically effective ... shows us Mr. Henty at his
best and brightest. The adventures will hold a boy of a winter's night
enthralled as he rushes through them with breathless interest 'from
cover to cover'."--_Observer._

     HENTY. Illustrated by J. R. WEGUELIN. 5_s._

"The story, from the critical moment of the killing of the sacred
cat to the perilous exodus into Asia with which it closes, is very
skilfully constructed and full of exciting adventures. It is admirably
illustrated."--_Saturday Review._

     =Maori and Settler:= A Story of the New Zealand War. By G. A.

     5_s._

life."--_Schoolmaster._

     =St. George for England:= A Tale of Cressy and Poitiers. By G.
     A. HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 5_s._

accompanied by magnanimity and gentleness."--_Pall Mall Gazette._

     =The Bravest of the Brave:= With Peterborough in Spain. By G.
     A. HENTY. With 8 full-page Pictures by H. M. PAGET.
     5_s._

"Mr. Henty never loses sight of the moral purpose of his work--to
enforce the doctrine of courage and truth, mercy and lovingkindness, as
indispensable to the making of an English gentleman. British lads will
read _The Bravest of the Brave_ with pleasure and profit; of that we
are quite sure."--_Daily Telegraph._

     =For Name and Fame:= or, Through Afghan Passes. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 5_s._

"Not only a rousing story, replete with all the varied forms of
excitement of a campaign, but, what is still more useful, an account
of a territory and its inhabitants which must for a long time possess
a supreme interest for Englishmen, as being the key to our Indian
Empire."--_Glasgow Herald._

     =A Jacobite Exile:= Being the Adventures of a Young Englishman in
     the Service of Charles XII. of Sweden. By G. A. HENTY.

at its close."--_Army and Navy Gazette._

     G. A. HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 5_s._

     =Condemned as a Nihilist:= A Story of Escape from Siberia. By
     G. A. HENTY. Illustrated by WALTER PAGET. 5_s._

"The best of this year's Henty. His narrative is more interesting than
many of the tales with which the public is familiar, of escape from
Siberia. Despite their superior claim to authenticity these tales are
without doubt no less fictitious than Mr. Henty's, and he beats them
hollow in the matter of sensations."--_National Observer._

     =Orange and Green:= A Tale of the Boyne and Limerick. By G. A.
     HENTY. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE. 5_s._

life as vivacious as if what is being described were really passing
before the eye.... Should be in the hands of every young student of
Irish history."--_Belfast News._

     G. A. HENTY. Illustrated by J. SCHÖNBERG. 5_s._

"Harry Sandwith, the Westminster boy, may fairly be said to beat Mr.
Henty's record. His adventures will delight boys by the audacity and
peril they depict. The story is one of Mr. Henty's best."--_Saturday
Review._

     HENTY. With 8 full-page Pictures by GORDON BROWNE.

before the boys a bright and bracing ideal of the English
gentleman."--_Christian Leader._

     =The Dragon and the Raven:= or, The Days of King Alfred. By G.
     A. HENTY. With 8 page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND,
     R.I. 5_s._

"A story that may justly be styled remarkable. Boys, in reading it,
will be surprised to find how Alfred persevered, through years of
bloodshed and times of peace, to rescue his people from the thraldom
of the Danes. We hope the book will soon be widely known in all our
schools."--_Schoolmaster._

     =A Final Reckoning:= A Tale of Bush Life in Australia. By G.
     A. HENTY. Illustrated by W. B. WOLLEN. 5_s._

"All boys will read this story with eager and unflagging interest.
The episodes are in Mr. Henty's very best vein--graphic, exciting,
realistic; and, as in all Mr. Henty's books, the tendency is
to the formation of an honourable, manly, and even heroic
character."--_Birmingham Post._

     A. HENTY. With 6 Illustrations by SIMON H. VEDDER.
     3_s._ 6_d._

facts quicken the imagination. No boy can read this book without
learning a great deal of South African history at its most critical
period."--_Standard._

     =A Chapter of Adventures=: or, Through the Bombardment of
     Alexandria. By G. A. HENTY. With 6 page Illustrations by
     W. H. OVEREND. 3_s._ 6_d._

"Jack Robson and his two companions have their fill of excitement, and
their chapter of adventures is so brisk and entertaining we could have
wished it longer than it is."--_Saturday Review._


BY KIRK MUNROE.

_In crown 8vo, cloth elegant, olivine edges._

     =Through Swamp and Glade:= A Tale of the Seminole War. By KIRK
     MUNROE. Illustrated by VICTOR PERARD. 5_s._

as that of the headmaster."--_St. James's Gazette._

     =At War With Pontiac:= or, The Totem of the Bear. By KIRK
     MUNROE. Illustrated by J. FINNEMORE. 5_s._

parallel of Hawkeye, as the Chingachgooks and Uncas have likewise their
counterparts."--_The Times._

     =The White Conquerors of Mexico:= A Tale of Toltec and Aztec. By
     KIRK MUNROE. Illustrated by W. S. STACEY. 5_s._

as well as useful, and there is a wonderful freshness in the Roman
scenes and characters."--_The Times._

     page Illustrations by GERTRUDE D. HAMMOND. 6_s._

letterpress and the illustrations. Miss Hammond has never done better
work."--_Review of Reviews._


     =The Heiress of Courtleroy.= By ANNE BEALE. With 8 page
     Illustrations by T. C. H. CASTLE. 5_s._

     DOUDNEY. Illustrated by G. G. KILBURNE. 4_s._

in style and original in conception; but we have seen nothing from her
pen equal in dramatic energy to this book."--_Christian Leader._

     MANVILLE FENN. Illustrated by FRANK DADD. 6_s._

last moment. It is rich in effective local colouring; and it has a
historical interest."--_Times._

     FENN. With 12 page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.
     6_s._

"An admirable story, as remarkable for the individuality of its
young heroes as for the excellent descriptions of coast scenery and
life in North Devon. It is one of the best books we have seen this
season."--_Athenæum._

     =The Golden Magnet:= A Tale of the Land of the Incas. By G.
     MANVILLE FENN. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE.
     6_s._

"There could be no more welcome present for a boy. There is not a dull
page in the book, and many will be read with breathless interest. 'The
Golden Magnet' is, of course, the same one that attracted Raleigh and
the heroes of _Westward Ho!_"--_Journal of Education._

     =In the King's Name:= or, The Cruise of the _Kestrel_. By G.
     MANVILLE FENN. Illustrated by GORDON BROWNE.
     6_s._

"The Library is one of the most intelligent enterprises in connection
with juvenile literature of recent years.... A glance at the list
proves that the editing is in the hands of some one who understands the
likings of healthy boys and girls.... One of the healthiest juvenile
libraries in existence."--=Bookman.=
