<div class="blockquot">
<p>"A model of what a boys' story-book should be. Mr. Henty has a great power

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of <i>Quentin Durward</i>. The lad's
journey across France with his faithful attendant Malcolm, and his hairbreadth

by<span class="smcap"> J. Schönberg</span>. 6<i>s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"A praiseworthy attempt to interest British youth in the great deeds of the
Scotch Brigade in the wars of Gustavus Adolphus. Mackay, Hepburn, and Munro
live again in Mr. Henty's pages, as those deserve to live whose disciplined bands
formed really the germ of the modern British army."&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

Hannibal. By <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. With 12 page Illustrations by <span class="smcap">C. J.

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The effect of an interesting story, well constructed and vividly told, is enhanced

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"It has a good plot; it abounds in action; the scenes are equally spirited and
realistic, and we can only say we have read it with much pleasure from first to
last. The pictures of life on a cattle ranch are most graphically painted, as are
the manners of the reckless but jovial cow-boys."&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

by <span class="smcap">W. S. Stacey</span>, and a Map. 6<i>s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"There are adventures of all kinds for the hero and his friends, whose pluck
and ingenuity in extricating themselves from awkward fixes are always equal to
the occasion. It is an excellent story, and if the proportion of history is smaller
than usual, the whole result leaves nothing to be desired."&mdash;<i>Journal of Education.</i></p>

which fall to be recorded after the dash for Khartoum has been made and failed
are quite as interesting as those which precede it."&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Wulf the Saxon</i> is second to none of Mr. Henty's historical tales, and we may

<h2><a name="BLACKIES" id="BLACKIES">BLACKIE'S
SCHOOL AND HOME LIBRARY.</a></h2>


<p>Under the above title the publishers have arranged to issue, for
School Libraries and the Home Circle, a selection of the best and most
interesting books in the English language. The Library includes lives
of heroes, ancient and modern, records of travel and adventure by sea
and land, fiction of the highest class, historical romances, books of
natural history, and tales of domestic life.</p>

<p>The greatest care has been devoted to the get-up of the Library.
The volumes are clearly printed on good paper, and the binding made
specially durable, to withstand the wear and tear to which well-circulated
books are necessarily subjected.</p>
